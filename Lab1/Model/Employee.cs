            "I was born in a modest neighborhood just outside Billings, Montana. From a young age, I was fascinated with how things worked. My father, an auto mechanic, used to joke that I had disassembled more appliances than we owned. By the age of 10, I had already rewired our home radio to accept external input and made a DIY metal detector out of copper wire, a plastic tray, and the guts of an old toy.\r\n\r\nMy formal education began at Roosevelt Elementary and culminated with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from Montana State University in 2000. But truth be told, most of what shaped me didn’t come from the classroom. It came from fixing farm equipment in minus-20°F winters, helping local ranchers install wind-powered water systems, and later, from troubleshooting mining equipment deep underground.\r\n\r\nAfter college, I joined a little-known drilling outfit out in Wyoming called Western SoilTech. I was 22, eager, and not entirely sure what I’d gotten myself into. The work was tough — 14-hour shifts, machinery that hadn’t been serviced in years, and team members who didn’t trust anyone under 40. But after a year, I’d earned their respect and started developing a reputation as “the guy who can fix just about anything.”\r\n\r\nOver the next two decades, my career wandered, as careers often do. I spent time overseas — six months in Northern Alberta helping with oil sand separation units, two years in Botswana setting up rural water delivery systems, and even a brief stint in Indonesia consulting for a geothermal startup. I’ve worked for large corporations, yes, but I always gravitated back to smaller teams where I could get my hands dirty and have a real impact.\r\n\r\nIn 2013, after my youngest daughter was born, I returned to Montana permanently. I took a senior engineering position with Hycroft Field Solutions, where I’ve since led over 45 major field deployment projects. I specialize in systems integration for off-grid environments, combining solar, wind, and kinetic energy systems. My proudest achievement? Designing a modular water-filtration system that could be deployed from a pickup truck and fully assembled by two people in under four hours. It's now used by NGOs in parts of Kenya and Peru.\r\n\r\nOutside of work, I’m a tinkerer. My garage is more machine shop than parking space. I build automated chicken coops, IoT-connected smoke detectors for neighbors, and even prototyped a wind-powered phone charger that my son and I tested during a weeklong hiking trip. I also run a local meetup called “Tools & Tales,” where retired engineers and curious teens talk shop over burgers.\r\n\r\nI’m not big on titles, and I’ll never wear a tie voluntarily. But I believe in showing up early, taking ownership of problems, and teaching what I know to the next guy. I’ve mentored dozens of junior engineers, many of whom now lead their own teams. And I keep learning — most recently Python, thanks to a free online course and a Raspberry Pi project gone wildly out of scope.\r\n\r\nI’m looking for work that matters, ideally on-site or in the field, where I can build, teach, and solve real-world problems. If you're the kind of organization that values experience over polish and substance over spin.",
            "I was born in Laredo, Texas, the youngest of five children in a household where stories, traditions, and resilience were passed around the dinner table like second helpings. My parents, first-generation immigrants from Mexico, taught me the value of education not through lectures but by example — my father worked nights as a janitor at the local courthouse, and my mother babysat half the neighborhood to help cover tuition for my older siblings.\r\n\r\nFrom a young age, I was drawn to language. I loved how words could open doors, connect people, and give shape to emotions that didn’t have names. I spent hours reading under a blanket with a flashlight, falling in love with poetry, then fiction, and finally — people. That’s what teaching was to me: not just passing on knowledge but making someone feel seen.\r\n\r\nI graduated from the University of Texas at Austin in 2004 with a degree in English and a minor in Education. That same year, I returned to South Texas to begin my career as a middle school teacher in a bilingual classroom. For the next 12 years, I taught students whose stories mirrored my own — children balancing two languages, two cultures, and often, more than their fair share of hardship. I taught literature, yes, but also how to navigate the world with curiosity and dignity.\r\n\r\nTeaching, however, was never just a job. I organized coat drives in winter, held weekend tutoring sessions at the public library, and brought in local authors to speak. In 2011, I helped launch Voces Jóvenes, an after-school writing program that gave students a platform to share their stories — some of which were later published in a community anthology that’s still passed around today.\r\n\r\nBut in 2016, something shifted. After witnessing firsthand how policy decisions impacted my students’ lives — from food insecurity to immigration raids — I felt compelled to step outside the classroom and into the broader community. That year, I took a leave of absence to work full-time as a community liaison for a local nonprofit, Bridges Beyond Borders. I started as a volunteer but was soon coordinating outreach events, facilitating legal aid sessions, and building coalitions between schools, shelters, and health clinics.\r\n\r\nBy 2018, I’d transitioned fully into advocacy work. I became Director of Outreach at the San Antonio Community Partnership Network, where I now oversee a team of ten and manage programs that serve over 1,000 families annually. My days are spent navigating complex systems, writing grant proposals, training volunteers, and sometimes, just listening — to mothers afraid to leave their homes, to kids trying to apply for DACA, to elders who want nothing more than to die in peace on their side of the border.\r\n\r\nI miss teaching. I still go back once a month to guest lecture or run poetry workshops. But I’ve found that the same skills — storytelling, empathy, patience — serve me well in this new role. I’ve spoken at city council meetings, helped rewrite tenant protection ordinances, and built a neighborhood food co-op from scratch after the last grocery store pulled out of the district.\r\n\r\nAlong the way, I’ve earned certifications in trauma-informed care, conflict resolution, and nonprofit leadership. I’ve learned to navigate bureaucracies, advocate for people in power, and translate legal jargon into human language. But I’ve also learned that success often looks like small, quiet victories: a grandmother who gets her citizenship after five years of limbo. A student who finally applies to college. A neighborhood that organizes its first block party after decades of fear.\r\n\r\nWhen I think about what comes next, I’m not chasing titles or prestige. I’m looking for meaningful work. I want to keep building things — programs, trust, community — and I want to do it with people who care as much as I do. If that’s you, I’m ready.",
            "I was born in Kraków in the late autumn of 1983, in a flat filled with the scent of old paper, black tea, and something always simmering on the stove. My grandfather had been a librarian before the war and continued his work unofficially during the years of silence and surveillance. His stories, passed down in hushed tones, planted in me a lifelong curiosity about what is remembered, and what is allowed to be remembered.\r\n\r\nMy mother taught literature at a liceum, and my father repaired watches. I grew up surrounded by books and the soft ticking of clocks — a household where both memory and time were taken seriously.\r\n\r\nI studied history at Jagiellonian University, specializing in Eastern European 20th-century memory politics. My MA thesis focused on the erasure of Jewish communities from rural town narratives in postwar Poland. It was during my research trips to Podlasie and the borderlands that I learned how fragile truth can be — buried not only under ruins, but under fear, shame, and sometimes, convenience.\r\n\r\nAfter graduating, I worked for five years at the Muzeum Historii Żydów Polskich in Warsaw, helping to curate personal archives and oral testimonies. I was responsible for digitizing family photo collections, transcribing interviews, and working with families of survivors to reconstruct fragmented stories. These were not glamorous years, but they were sacred. I often felt like I was holding broken glass in my hands — painful, sharp, but still shining.\r\n\r\nIn 2013, I returned to Kraków and took a position with the National Archive, where I helped modernize the collection’s metadata system. But my heart stayed with the quieter work — the unrecognized archives. That’s when I began my independent research. Over the past decade, I’ve been quietly collecting and preserving “forgotten histories” — family letters, audio tapes, war diaries, even grocery lists found in flea markets. I’ve built a private catalog of over 3,000 objects, many of which have since been donated to regional museums or repatriated to descendants abroad.\r\n\r\nI’ve also collaborated on several international projects: cataloging Jewish cemeteries in the Subcarpathian Voivodeship, documenting the life stories of Romani elders in southern Poland, and contributing research to a Dutch-Polish initiative about wartime resistance couriers. In 2020, I was invited to guest lecture at the University of Amsterdam, where I spoke on “Personal Memory vs. National Mythology.”\r\n\r\nOutside of my formal work, I offer free workshops at community centers on how to preserve family history — how to digitize old photographs, how to conduct oral history interviews, how to read your grandmother’s cursive. I believe that history belongs to everyone, and that memory is not just the domain of scholars.\r\n\r\nI’m fluent in Polish and English, conversational in Yiddish, and capable of reading German, Russian, and Ukrainian with a dictionary in hand. I’ve never chased academic titles, and I don’t see myself publishing in high-impact journals. But I have helped hundreds of people find pieces of their own story — and in doing so, built a quiet legacy of care.\r\n\r\nI’m looking for work that honors the past without weaponizing it. Whether it’s in a museum, an archive, or a humble project hidden from the public eye, I want to continue helping people find what was lost — and preserve it, gently, for whoever comes next.",

            "My life began when I was born at approximately [birth time ] on [birth date]. I was born in [birth city] at [hospital in city]. At birth, I weighed 6 pounds, 4 ounces and was 19 inches in length. I had dark blue eyes and light brown hair.\r\nSome of my favorite toys when I was young were my musical mobile and my pet, Neal (a stuffed animal frog). I had two dogs name Boozer and Jigger. I also had a horse named Sassy Suzie. Actually, the horse belonged to my dad but I considered it my horse too.\r\nAt my first birthday some on my friends were invited and had a nice time. My friend, Scott and I decided to try eating the candles first before the cake and we didn’t do so good. At my first Christmas I liked to play in the boxes rather than with the toys.\r\nMy first nursery school was Catalina Methodist Day School. My teacher was Miss Laura. My best friends were Scott and Kevin. My best subjects were coloring, the ABC’s, numbers, and solving puzzles. When I was three we moved to Phoenix into an apartment because we were waiting to have our house built. A year later my sister was born and I got to feed her just a few hours after she was born. While my mother stayed in the hospital I stayed at my grandparent’s house. While I was there I went bike riding with my grandfather and my foot accidentally got caught in the spokes, so I ended up going to the doctor too.\r\nWhen i was five, we moved to Peoria, Arizona into our new house. I started kindergarten in Orangewood School. My teacher’s name was Mrs. Kutchen. I found four new friends who lived nearby and their names were Grady, Scott, Josh, and Charissa. I had many other friends at school and I enjoyed school very much.\r\nIn the middle of first grade we moved to Mahwah, New Jersey. We rented a house until we found one to buy (about six months later). When we found the new house, I went to Betsy Ross School. I still live in the same house on 31 Armour Rd. I’ve enjoyed Mahwah since I moved here but someday I want to move back to Arizona. Ten words best describing me are probably thoughtful, enjoyable, fun, intelligent, curious, interesting, short, nosey, naive, and independent.\r\nMy dad is hardworking, quiet, naive, nice, fun, tired, enjoyable, forgetful, caring and great.\r\nMy mom is strict, hardworking, intelligent, nice, fun, interesting, pretty, tall, terrific and thoughtful.\r\nMy sister, Cari, is soft-spoken, bossy, nosey, hardworking, caring, nice, intelligent, sleepy, curious and boring.\r\nIn five years I expect to be in college, working on my studies. In ten years I hope to be in medical school learning to be a doctor. I twenty years I hope to be working as a doctor specializing in orthopedic surgery. I would like to become a professional in this type of work.\r\nI spend my time on weekends going over to someone’s house or someone coming to my house. If I don’t do that, I’ll go skiing in the winter, baseball in the spring and soccer in the fall. I also do chores before I go outside.\r\nI like to ski the most because it’s something that I’m good at and enjoy. It sets me free and I have no worries. The least favorite thing to do is playing on the computer because I have played all of the games a lot of times.\r\nThe qualities of adults I respect and admire the most are being enjoyable and having fun because with all the worries of adults it’s remarkable to see them have fun and let go of all worries. The quality I least respect is when adults misunderstand you and yell at you.\r\nMy best friend is Scott. He’s my best friend because we’ve known each other for our whole lives. We get along and enjoy each other a lot. Some things we have in common are the same sports, interests, and qualities. My favorite sports are skiing, running, and baseball. I like skiing a lot and I enjoy it. I like running because it’s good exercise and it’s fun trying to better your time race by race. I also like baseball because it’s fast and action-packed. I like these sports because they’re fact and you don’t know know what to expect.\r\nMy favorite television shows are Night Court, Growing Pains, and Cheers. Night Court is my favorite because the characters are great. John Larroquette is so funny I can’t stand up straight. Growing Pains and Cheers are also wonderful because of the laughter. I love the way Ted Danson tries to get a date with anyone.\r\nI enjoy reading Sports Illustrated and National Geographic. I like Sports Illustrated because I’m a big sports fan and I like to read the articles. I like National Geographic because I enjoy reading things about nature and people around the world.\r\nFriends enjoy my company because I don’t make a fuss or complain if they want to do something other than what I would want to do. I feel that I am fair to all my friends and trustworthy also. I know that I am not bossy and I hope I’m not a pain in the neck.\r\nMajor goals I am working for right now are finishing high school and college and getting a good job. I hope to go to a good college and study to be a doctor. If I decide not to be a doctor, I wish to be working in the field of mathematics and science. If I get a decent job I will try and move up to higher levels of the job and hopefully be able to retire by the age of 65 and move down to Arizona to buy a ranch and race horses.\r\nFriendship is a big thing with me because I think life is too hard to live without friends. Friends are someone to depend on when you’re down in the dumps. Friends are people who respect you and have a good relationship with you. Friends don’t con you into doing things your don’t want to do. I believe friends are one of the top five dependents of life. School is very important to me because without school it would be hard to make a living. I also like school because it gives me a challenge to better myself and my grades. School affects your whole life because if you don’t get good grades you might now be able to get a good job your whole life. Even though it isn’t my favorite thing to do, I’ll probably look back and think thank God I went to school.\r\nI’m sometimes content with myself if I try my hardest. If I don’t try my hardest, I wish that I would have been better so I wouldn’t be upset with myself. I feel like if you don’t try your hardest you shouldn’t be able to succeed and achieve your goals.\r\nI like to spend my time after school doing things I like to do. I enjoy playing with my friends or watching T.V. In the spring I’ll play baseball with some friends at the baseball field. Sometimes I go to a Chinese restaurant and play video games.\r\nRight now I’m 14 year old and loving every year so far. My family just came back from our first trip to Florida. It was great. I loved the sights and Disney World. We stayed at Disney World for four days and we met our friends, Mr. and Mrs. Downs and Matt and Melissa Downs. Matt and I went on every ride in the park at least twice. We also went to Sea World which I like because I love marine animals.\r\nWhen we weren’t at Disney World, we stayed at my grandmother’s. When we were there, my grandmother took us to the NASA Space Center. It was real neat. My family is also planning a trip to Cancun, Mexico in December. I can’t wait.\r\nI hope you’ve enjoyed my autobiography as much as I’ve enjoyed my life. I hope that the rest of my life will be an enjoyable as the first 14 years. I hope to live a healthy and long life to its fullest.\r\n"
